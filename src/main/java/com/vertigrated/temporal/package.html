Contains time related classes and utility functions.
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package for all Time related objects so that you should never have to deal with the Java Calendar classes and
sub-classes directly. All these classes wrap or delegate to the standard library classes, they don't re-implement any
functionality, they just provide sane object oriented interfaces.
